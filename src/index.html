                    If you're looking for an old-fashioned "do not stir" style of blackberry cobbler, you've come to the right place. The magic of this recipe lies in the layering technique: as it bakes, the batter rises to the top, creating a crisp crust that pairs perfectly with the sweet and slightly tart blackberries below.

                    <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided</li>

                    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prepare the oven and dish:</strong> Preheat oven to 375°F. Place butter in a 13 x 9–inch baking dish and set it in the oven as it heats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make the blackberry mixture:</strong> While the oven heats, toss blackberries with 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare the batter:</strong> Whisk together flour, remaining 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add milk and vanilla, and whisk until smooth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assemble the cobbler:</strong> Carefully remove the baking dish from the oven once the butter is melted. Pour the batter evenly over the butter. Do not stir. Scatter the blackberry mixture (including any juices) over the batter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bake the cobbler:</strong> Bake at 375°F for 40-45 minutes until the topping is golden brown and the fruit mixture is bubbly. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Helpful Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blackberries:</strong> Fresh, plump blackberries work best for this recipe. If out of season, frozen blackberries can be used. Thaw them before use and drain any excess liquid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Salted butter adds an extra layer of flavor to the cobbler, balancing the sweetness of the berries and batter. For an even richer flavor, try using brown butter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> A teaspoon of vanilla adds warmth and enhances the flavor of the fruit, making the dessert even more aromatic and inviting.</li>
                </ul>
