  <h1>Old-Fashioned Blackberry Cobbler</h1>

  <h2>That tastes like home. </h2>
   <h3>By: Ann Taylor Pittman </h3>

  <p>If you're looking for a classic dessert that perfectly captures the essence of summer, this Blackberry Cobbler is just the ticket. Made with fresh, juicy blackberries and a buttery, golden crust, this cobbler is both comforting and irresistible. Whether you're serving it at a family gathering, a holiday celebration, or simply treating yourself, the balance of sweet blackberries with a light, fluffy batter makes this dish a winner. Best of all, it’s incredibly simple to prepare with just a few pantry staples and some fresh fruit.
 </p>
  
   <p>The batter magically rises up through the berry mixture to become the topping, with its crispy, chewy, buttery edges. As it makes its way up through the berry mixture, it also slightly thickens the fruit for outstanding texture. </p>

 
  <p> The secret to this cobbler is the balance between tart blackberries and a subtly sweet, soft crust. Unlike pies that require a lot of crust prep, this cobbler features a pourable batter, making it quick to assemble. The butter melts directly in the pan while the oven preheats, which allows the batter to rise up around the blackberries as it bakes, creating a beautiful golden topping. It's a perfect dessert for blackberry season but can also be made year-round with frozen berries.
The no-stirring instructions are important: You want the butter to be pushed to the outer edges when you top it with the batter so the crust bakes perfectly</p>

  <h2> Ingrediant Tips</h2> 
  <ul> <li>Blackberries: Fresh, plump blackberries work best for this recipe. If they’re out of season, frozen blackberries can be used, but thaw them before use and drain any excess liquid.</li> 
    <li> Butter: Salted butter adds an extra layer of flavor to the cobbler, balancing the sweetness of the berries and batter. For an even richer flavor, you can experiment with brown butter.</li> 
    <li> Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla adds warmth and enhances the flavor of the fruit, making the dessert even more aromatic and inviting.</li> 
    
<h2>Directions:</h2>
    
<ol>
  <li>Prepare the oven and dish: Preheat oven to 375°F. Place butter in a 13 x 9–inch baking dish and set it in the oven as it heats.</li>
